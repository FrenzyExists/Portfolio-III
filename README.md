# Richmercy, a firefox theme based on Cascade, Simplefox and other random firefox themes scattered across the internet

Note:
This is on a early stage. It's usable, but there' lots of stuff that have
not been themed, so be warned.

Its still somewhat messy, but I'm slowly commenting everything for the sake
of keeping everything clear, I hope
