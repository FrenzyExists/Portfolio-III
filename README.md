# Detective Pikachu's Personal Web Portfolio

### Yep this time I over do it

My third personal website and hopefully my last. Includes my blog posts and a scrapper that uses the Github API to list and index my projects. Some of the blogs are related to said projects, give it a read!

## Story

I wanted to make something that I could maintain over time and evolve as I improve myself. So instead of using the classic html/css static page I opted for a framework. Now, I could instead use something like Wordpress, as I worked with it on a job in college. However, I wanted to have full granular control of my website, and honestly I just like to DIY stuff. Took quite some time, as I this was my way to get into Vue3.

About the vision I had of the website... it was NOT what it turned out to be like. I actually had to constantly change the colors, the structure, and the overall concept of what I wanted on my website over time. As a boss I worked used to say "Everything is a process".
