# Detective Pikachu's Personal Web Portfolio

This is (currently) my latest portfolio, and hopefully if scalibility is right it will be my last (web dev is a lie). It is built using Vue with Vite and a couple of nice Vite plugins to easen things a bit.

It supports markdown parsing, can send emails for contact info, light/dark mode, and supports a Comment system with the ability to reply. In order to make it independent from Github in case Github somehow some way falls it also requires the user to create its username and provide its email.

If you believe the website should have another feature feel free to open an Issue and comment your thoughts. Personally I really can't think of anything else a portfolio site should contain other than what it has already. 

## A bit of a backstory

This little project started as an exercise for me to learn and experiment with the Vue.js framework and see how it differs from React. As time went on I ended up putting myself goals as challenges, like markdown support, tho that would translate to a scavenger hunt for packages. Still, a challenge. I wanted to make something that I could maintain over time and evolve as I improve myself. And then I decided to turn this into my next and hopefully last porfolio website. I wanted to have full granular control of my website, and usually frameworks like Vue and React allow for such control, with the compromise of doing everything yourself. Fortunately, I'm the type who enjoys DIY.

About the vision I had of the website... it was NOT what it turned out to be like. I actually had to constantly change the colors, the structure, and the overall concept of what I wanted on my website over time. As a boss I worked used to say "Everything is a process".
