                    Hi! My name is Angel, but is very likely you know me as
                    <span class="italic">Pikachu</span> I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University
                    of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez. I've always been fascinated by the way computers and circuits
                    work and how they can be used to solve complex problems. My passion for programming
                    started since my days in middle school when playing Flash games like Smash Flash 2.
                    Youtube had lots of tutorials on Game Maker and when I got in highschool I started to
                    "program" with tutorials. Although I was able to make a simple platform game, I still had
                    trouble understanding object-oriented concepts like polyphormism and posponed my hobbie.
                    Several years later I would take the basic courses like Algorithms and Advanced
                    Programming to finally set myself on switching from studying Surveying Engineering to
                    Computer Engineering on my 4th year. And although the change wasn't easy, I don't regret
                    it!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently working on a research project with a professor in the Electrical
                    Engineering department where we are developing a GUI for an existing testing CLI developed
                    by Texas Instruments engineers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also currently develop frontend in my free time and experiment with Arduino and ESP-32
                    boards. I am also an active member of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Asociation as a
                    Webmaster asistant and as Webmaster for the IEEE in my university. I am excited about the
                    future of technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I hope to be
                    part of this change by contributing my skills and knowledge.
                </p>
