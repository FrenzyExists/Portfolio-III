# Learning Log: Think about data in daily life

## Overview

By now, you've started to discover how powerful data can be. Throughout this course, you’ll be asked to make entries in a learning log. Your log will be a personal space where you can keep track of your thinking and reflections about the experiences you will have collecting and analyzing data. Reflections may include what you liked, what you would change, and questions that were raised. By the time you complete the entry for this activity, you will have a stronger understanding of data analytics. 

## Everyday data 

Before you write an entry in your learning log, think about where and how you use data to make decisions. You will create a list of at least five questions that you might use data to answer. Here are a few examples to inspire you:

- What’s the best time to go to the gym?
- How does the length of your commute to work vary by day of the week?
- How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?
- What flavor of ice cream do customers buy?
- How many hours of sleep do you get each day? 

Then, you will select one of the five questions from your list to explore further and write down the types of data you might collect in order to make a decision. That’s data analysis in action!

### Note:
> *A lot of the examples are definitely for active Sillicon Valley workers and are the last kind of things I would bother/evade to think about. In other words, I am as abnormal as you can think.*


## Reflection

After you consider how you use data analysis in your own life, take a moment to reflect on what you discovered. Reflections may include what you liked, what you would change, and questions that were raised. In your new learning log entry, you will write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each question below:

- What are some considerations or preferences you want to keep in mind when making a decision?
- What kind of information or data do you have access to that will influence your decision?
- Are there any other things you might want to track associated with this decision?

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.

*The page includes a template and an example for me to follow. Now I gonna be honest to you, writing is not something I enjoy, I kind of hate it. Very ironic, I know, considering that I spent my summer making a blog site from scratch. I **have** to do it. Normal people have blogs, specially succesfull people. What other choice I have? Pretend, get bulldozers, reap whatever rewards people call rewards.*

# Notes

Throughout the videos I also took some notes and whatnot. Here's a transcript of some of those notes


#### Video: Intro to the course

What Doyle meant was that Holmes couldn't draw any conclusions, which would be the bricks he mentioned without data, or the clay.

> My Notes:
*I really should read books more :\ Also I wonder if I could scrap these notes... would be convenient to add it to my local notes*

> Data: A collection of facts or information

Data Analysis can be applied for a broad field. Its required in:
- Healthcare
- Finance
- Communications
- Government (CCP would like to know your location)
- Consumer Product

Businesses need a way to control all that data so they can use it to:
- improve processes
- identify opportunities and trends
- launch new products
- serve customers
- make thoughtful decisions.

Clip 2:34 - 2:47

For businesses to be on top of the competition, they need to be on top of their data. That data is collected daily and we're talking Gigabytes of Data and even Terrabytes worth of data. Data analyst filter and manipulate data to make sense of it, and then draw conclusions or make predictions. This is the process of turning data into insights, and it's how analysts help businesses put all their data to good use.

*DEFINITIONS*

Data Analysis -> Collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making



**IMPORTANT**

Obtaining the Google Data Analytics Certificate
After you complete all eight courses, you qualify for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. To receive your certificate, you must:

> Pass all required assignments in the course or meet the course-passing threshold. Each graded assignment is part of a cumulative graded score, and the passing grade for the Google Data Analytics Certificate is 80%. 

#### Helpful habits for successfully completing the certificate

As a learner, you’re bringing all of your past experiences and best learning practices to this program. The designers of this course have also put together a list of helpful habits that they believe will help you to be the most successful: 

*Plan your time*: Setting regular study times and sticking with them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule. Listing what you plan to do each day will break your work down into achievable goals. And creating a quiet place to watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities is important, so you can really focus on the material.

*Learn in order*: We recommend taking these courses — and the items in each lesson — in the order they appear, as new information and concepts build on previous ones. By following the order, you’ll be able to get comfortable with ideas, then practice and build on them.

*Be curious*: If you find an idea that gets you excited, please act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, check out the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The little things you do to support your learning along the way will take your knowledge even further; open more doors in this new, high-growth field; and help you qualify for all kinds of new jobs. 

*Take notes*: Notes are useful when researching something you’re curious about. This is especially helpful when a task seems important and you think it might be useful later. Or, sometimes you might come across a subject that you want to explore in more detail. Keeping notes can help you keep track of what you learn. Finally, taking notes is an effective way to help make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of them. You can use your notes to build your very own data analytics journal — a place where you can capture ideas, information, and any questions you might have. You’ll probably want to keep your notes together in one place-- whether that’s a physical journal or a document on your computer. This will make it easier to stay organized. Feel free to revisit your journal as you progress through the program, during your job hunt, and even as you settle into your new role as a data analyst.
