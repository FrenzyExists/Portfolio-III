Ever since I played my first pokemon game *Pokemon Emerald* on a gameboy emulator on a beater of a laptop I got fascinated on how a small 6MB game could have a full-blown database (the pokedex), and have so many pokemons, moves, and possible effects. Back then I was just a teenager and barely knew how to program. Like I was **really** struggling with basic concepts from the GameMaker engine back in the day. So of course I kinda gave up on the thought that one day I could mimic something akin to a 1st gen pokedex. A decade later and after finishing my Databases college course I realized that... its not really that hard.

I think that the hardest part of a database is actually the planning and design rather than the coding itself. Which is interesting because depending on how well you design your ER Diagram it will affects how complex your SQL code will be. That said, even a well-made ER Diagram can change in complexity over time as the customer's need evolve.
