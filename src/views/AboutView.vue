    <h1>This is an about page</h1>

    <p>My real name is Angel Garcia, but prefer to go by Pikachu on the internet, its less formal. I started formally learning programming at my 3rd year of college in Java. Since then I've been tinkering from time to time in other languages. During that time I also learned about Linux thanks to two instructors who used Manjaro and Ubuntu. A year later or so I learned about r/unixporn and started tinkering with dotfiles, getting into some basic bash and trying neovim for the first time. I think it was at the summer of that time, but around there I made some trinkets in python, specifically with pygame. I did a simple game and tried to make a tile generator, tho that one got lost in my old laptop. Anyway, changed to Computer Engineering in my 4th year, took my data structures in Java and I still hate that language.</p>

    <p>Most of the progress I got is from this year and past one i think. First is with my pokedex that I kept posponing for 2 to 3 years. The next is this site, which I posponed since last year. I tend to do that a lot.</p>

    <p>My languages are spanish and english, I speak both fluently. Doesn't mean I like to speak tho</p>
